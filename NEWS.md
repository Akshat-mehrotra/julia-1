Julia v1.5 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------


Language changes
----------------

* In docstrings, a level-1 markdown header "Extended help" is now
  interpreted as a marker dividing "brief help" from "extended help."
  The REPL help mode only shows the brief help (the content before the
  "Extended help" header) by default; prepend the expression with '?'
  (in addition to the one that enters the help mode) to see the full
  docstring. ([#25903])
